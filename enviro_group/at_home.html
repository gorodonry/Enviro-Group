				<p>New Zealand has a national goal of becoming predator free by 2050, but this can only be achieved with some effort and committment from the general public. On top of this is our goal of reintroducing native plant species - and killing the weeds. This page outlines some ways you can help.</p>

				<h4>Build Your Own Trapping Tunnel</h4>
				<section>
					<img src = "images/trapping_tunnel.jpg" alt = "Trapping tunnel.">
					<p>Trapping tunnels are dual purpose, rats and mice like dark places to hide in, and a tunnel excludes non target species (weka, chickens, cats etc) from getting caught in the trap. They are easy to make. You need some fence palings (these are good as they are tanalised so will not rot when left outside), and some wire mesh – the sort with small squares is best. Cut four lengths of fence paling, 2 at 40cm, 1 at 38cm, 1 at 42cm. On the 2 40cm pieces, cut a groove at one end, 1 cm in from the end. This should go through about half the thickness. Now nail the four pieces into a box. The shortest piece is the top, the ones with the grooves are the sides – the end with the grooves should stick out past the top, but be shorter than the bottom, which is the longest piece. Nail a piece of mesh over the end without the grooves, and cut a rat sized hole in it. Cut another piece of mesh to slot into the grooves – leave this a bit tall and bend the top over, this makes it easier to remove and put back. Now add a mouse trap and a rat trap... Good luck!</p>

				<h4>Composting</h4>
				<p>This is an easy thing to do at home. It reduces waste to landfill and turns your kitchen scraps into something good to add to the soil in your garden. At its easiest, it's a bin you put your scraps into. It is good to turn it over every now and again; quite possibly you will end up with a resident rat doing this for you, so it can be a good idea to have a rat trap near the compost bin. A lot of weeds can also be composted – you soon learn which ones are still weeds when they come out the other end (they'll still be alive, blast them)! Avoid putting meat scraps or fat in your compost, that will guarantee rats. Best results come from a mix of vege scraps, and weeds or lawn clippings, with occasionally a bit of wood ash. Preferably non-tanalised, and not too many rusty nails!<br><br>Plants love compost. Every once in a while you can take the decomposed matter at the bottom of the bin and dig it into a garden before planting. Then sit back and watch the plants thrive!</p>

				<h4>Weeding</h4>
				<section>
					<img src = "images/weeded_plant.jpg" alt = "Weeded plant." title = "Broad beans.">
					<p>One of the most important jobs for revegetation is weeding. Planting is fun, and you feel like you've achieved something, but it works best if you go back a couple of times a year and 'release' the plants. This just means weeding the area immediately around them, so there is less competition from weeds and they don't get smothered. It's also good to weed your home garden. As well as making it look tidy (bonus) you are not being a weed seed source for all your neighbours. Main rule for weeding is roots and all, it's no use just pulling the tops off. Rip in!<br><br>Weeding is a necessary evil. Although it isn't fun, it is crucial for plant survival. There is no point planting if they just succumb to the overwhelming numbers of weeds. Tip: weeds are at their worst in autumn and spring. This is a good time to weed.</p>

				<img src = "images/tradescantia.jpg" alt = "Tradescantia." title = "Tradescantia - an incredibly invasive species.">
				<h4>Do You Have the Right Plant?</h4>
				<p>We grow a lot of weeds in our gardens, and many of them we don't even know are weeds. They can be very attractive garden plants, but an invasive weed when they get half a chance. A good example would be Agapanthus – such a useful plant, copes well with dry banks, nothing eats it, it bulks itself up to fill any gaps in the planting, tough as old boots, shade tolerant, survives droughts, high winds etc, needs no maintenance, and has pretty flowers that produce lots of viable seeds. All of which are characteristics that make it a very successful weed, when you start to think about it. So Weedbusters have produced a publication called 'Plant Me Instead', which suggests non-invasive plants you can try instead of growing weeds such as Agapanthus. Check it out, and then have a look around your garden... Link to the website <a href = "https://www.weedbusters.org.nz/site/assets/files/1085/plantpmi_wellington_final_screen.pdf">here</a>.</p>
