				<h4>The Role of Trees</h4>
				<section>
					<img src = "images/hard_beech.jpg" alt = "Hard Beech tree">
					<p>Trees are often (and accurately) described as the lungs of the planet. Through the process of photosynthesis a tree combines light, glucose and carbon dioxide to make energy and oxygen. The tree keeps the energy for itself and releases the oxygen as a by-product. Oxygen is necessary for our continued existence. Without it, our bodies cannot make energy and would therefore wither away and die. When trees and us work together, the levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen are kept in equilibrium and existential crises such as climate change are avoided.<br><br>Trees act as carbon sinks, over their lifetime sequestering huge amounts of carbon (the actual amount is extremely variable), removing it and its potential to trap heat from the atmosphere. Carbon, in its capacity as a greenhouse gas, is the driving force behind climate change. Trees prevent climate change in more than one way.<br><br>Trees have enormous root systems beneath them, which prevent slips and other natural disasters. You might be thinking, how could this be if tree roots go down? If you are, then allow me to correct you. There is only a thin layer of nutrient rich soil which trees are interested in and this is found on the surface. Accordingly, tree roots spread out along the surface and provide structural integrity in steep areas.<br><br>Last but not least, trees are beautiful. Everyone loves a good tree and the world would (wood?) be a far better place with more of them. They beautify areas and encourage birds to visit. The list is endless! I will stop here.</p>

				<h4>The Importance of Biodiversity</h4>
				<!-- Relevant quote on the importance of biodiversity. This has special formatting -->
				<div class = "quote">
					<p><em>“Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.” - John Donne</em></p>
				</div>
				<p> Biodiversity is important. We have lost so much already, and every species lost makes us sadder and lonelier on the planet. If we allow this process to continue to its logical conclusion, we will leave a planet inhabited by weeds, rats and cockroaches... I don't want to live there. I would have loved to see this country when it was occupied by moa, being hunted by Haast's eagle. Habitat destruction not only destroys species, it adds to our climate change problems, and with some ecologies, once they are destroyed they will take hundreds of years to recover, if they do at all... the seed sources may have been lost, not to mention the animals that lived there.</p>

				<img src = "images/stoat.jpg" alt = "Stoat." title = "The stoat - cute but so very evil and damaging in NZ.">
				<h4>Invasive Species</h4>
				<p>New Zealand originally had no mammals except bats. People settling here have brought their animals with them, some intentionally, some as stowaways. Thankfully not all these introductions have been successful, but the ones that have established here are quite bad enough. Our forests are being eaten by possums, deer, goats and pigs, our birds are predated by rats, stoats, cats and occasionally possums. Ecological cycles such as beech mast years which would previously have meant a good breeding season for our birds are now an ecological disaster as rats breed exponentially on the bonanza of beech seeds, and then eat everything else as this food source is exhausted. Our bush is much quieter than it used to be, and in many places the dawn chorus is a thing of the past. Birds that are poorly adapted to deal with predators are now extinct or very endangered. We can try and do some things to turn the tide. Trap in your back yard, volunteer to help trap in a reserve near you, inform your voting choices carefully, tell your friends.</p>

				<h4>Littering</h4>
				<section>
					<img src = "images/turtle.jpg" alt = "Think of the turtles." title = "Think of the turtles.">
					<p>DON'T!!! This is about the worst thing you can do! We are an extraordinarily wasteful species. We generate a lot of rubbish, most of it unnecessary. If we are careful how we dispose of it, a lot of it still ends up in landfill, which is bad enough; if we aren't careful with it it gets everwhere, and a lot of it ends up in our waterways and oceans. Many plastics don't really break down, they just make smaller and smaller pieces of incredibly durable rubbish. Once in the sea, plastics make their way on the currents to places where currents end up, and form gyres. Worse, because of the currents, these places are often places where marine animals congregate. They arrive... and find a mouthful of plastic. Littering has got so bad that in some of these places there are accumulations of plastic as large as small countries. It's best not to generate it in the first place, but if you do end up with single use plastic, dispose of it carefully. This is something we can all help with. Choose your store bought products wisely and reduce the obscene amount of plastic in our world.

				<h4>Climate Change</h4>
				<p>As I'm sure you're all painfully aware, the planet and all life on it is dying by slow degrees at present, the driving force behind this being climate change. But what does this actually mean? While we all know it's happening, most of us aren't aware of the particulars or just how much trouble we're in. This section contains some information on this.<br><br>Climate change is a problem - understatement of the century. Climate change is the single biggest threat to our existence we have faced so far. Carbon dioxide traps heat from the sun in the atmosphere, which is important for our survival - up to a point. Too much carbon dioxide means a rise in global temperatures and this is what we are experiencing at the moment. Unprecedented carbon dioxide levels are more rapidly than we lke to think causing sea level rise, more frequent extreme weather, ocean acidification, and an enormous loss of life and biodiversity. All of which are very, very bad.<br><br>With the rise in global temperatures the polar ice caps are slowly but surely melting, adding over time all of their combined 35 million cubic kilometres of ice to the sea. A lot of major cities in the world will be affected by this rise - all the ones on coasts (to name a few: New York, Wellington, Auckland, Rio de Janeiro, London, Seattle, Vancouver, Capetown, Perth, Sydney, Jakarta, Shanghai, Lisbon, Casablanca, Bombay, Singapore, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Istanbul, Glasgow, Los Angeles, Venice, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and San Francisco). If we don't act now these cities will all be swamped by sea level rise.</p>
				<section>
					<img id = "secondClimateImage" src = "images/wildfire.jpg" alt = "California wildfires">
					<p>A global temperature rise will also mean more frequent extreme weather. Heat is a form of energy, and the more energy you put into a system, the more energy comes out of it. Only this time the system getting an overload of energy is Earth's <em>weather</em> system. If we don't stop climate change we will see more frequent, more devastating, farther reaching cyclones/tornadoes/hurricanes/typhoons. The huge wildfires we've seen this year are just a warning of what is to come. Which is a problem.<br><br>We haven't been seeing the effects of climate change much yet. The reason for this is that the seas have been acting as a carbon sink, absorbing excess carbon from the atmosphere. While this may sound good, it isn't. This extra carbon in the sea is causing the acidity of the oceans to increase, and the rapid increase in acidity is proving too much for marine life. They simply can't adapt to the new acidity levels quickly enough and are dying out in droves.<br><br>Similarly, surface animals also can't cope with the rapid change in the environment and are slowly but surely dying out. Now, all this sounds really, <em>really</em> bad, but the actual situation can be brought under control with responsible actions. These can be as simple as reducing the amount of waste you produce and planting some trees - everything the Onslow Enviro Group stands for!</p>
