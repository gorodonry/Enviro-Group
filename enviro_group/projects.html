				<p>These are projects we are committed to running year after year, building a better future in the long run. We have three year-round projects that are listed below, plus the Vegetarian and Vegan Food Fair which we hold every year early in term 2.</p>

				<h4>Recycling and Waste Minimisation</h4>
				<section>
					<img src = "images/bins.jpg" alt = "School bins.">
					<p>The first project we run throughout the year is the promotion and coordination of recycling at Onslow, with special emphasis on a reduction in plastic. Plastic, although useful, is causing us an existential crisis. As one of New Zealand's foremost actors Sam Neill points out in a video on plastic and its effect; <em>"the pacific ocean is close to crisis"</em> with the sheer amount of single-use plastic we are dumping in it. Watch the full video <a href = "https://tinyurl.com/y7er8z58">here</a> - it's really good, both easy to understand and informative.<br><br>To accomplish all this we have co-leaders who work alongside teachers to come up with innovative ways to reduce waste and promote recycling. Currently we are organising school-clean ups throughout the year, have provided categorised bins (see right - red = landfill, yellow = recylcing, green = organics), and introduced reusable cups to the canteen. While this is all well and good, we can't do this without your cooperation. We need you on side our project for it to reach full potential. Do your bit for the environment; bring a sustainably packed lunch and use the bins provided sensibly. This is an environmental crisis we're dealing with here, it isn't a game.</p>

				<h4>Ecological Monitoring and Predator Trapping</h4>
				<p>The second project we run throughout the year is to do with pest control and environmental stability. We work with Papa Taiao Earthcare to monitor and control invasive species at Onslow. Teams of at least five students (volunteers) work together to try and determine, and eventually eradicate, the predators present at Onslow's restoration areas. Enviro group co-leaders oversee these teams and work alongside teachers and the people at Papa Taiao. NCEA credits are on offer through this program. If this suddenly sparks a desire to help the environment, email us at <a href = "mailto:enviro@onslow.school.nz?subject=Predator%20Eradication%20Interest%20(contact%20from%20website)">enviro@onslow.school.nz</a> to express interest or get more information - the more volunteers we have, the better.<br><br>Ecological monitoring is like a bioblitz - a continuously updated documentation of all the species in an area. For animals, this is done using tracking tunnels and chew cards, as well as sightings by humans. A tracking tunnel is a narrow tunnel (designed for animals the size of rats and stoats) about half a metre long with a patch of ink in the centre. Animals that go through the tunnel tread on the ink and leave distinctive footprints inside the tunnel. These footprints allow us to determine the species in the area. Chew cards serve a similar purpose - these are small plastice cards with bait applied to their corners. When an animal comes along and eats the bait, we can determine the species by looking at the teeth marks.<br><br>Predator trapping is done in a similar manner, the most common method being either trapping tunnels or baiting. Trapping tunnels (see above: DOC rat and stoat trap) are very similar to tracking tunnels, but instead of a patch of ink in the middle, there is a trap that kills efficiently and humanely. The traps we use aren't designed to merely injure - we are not causing any drawn out pain to animals we catch. This process, although not as reliable, doesn't tend to kill any native species as they are not interested in the tunnels. Baiting is where poison is left out in the open for animals to come and eat. This is slightly more risky, as, depending on the bait, the bait can be sought after by native species as well as introduced species. The baits we use only target introduced species.<br><br>Predator monitoring is important for the survival of our native species. Introduced species are incredibly harmful to our native species and have driven many to the brink of extinction(like the kakapo), with some even reaching extinction (like the huia).

				<h4>Vegetable Gardening and Forest Restoration</h4>
				<section>
					<img src = "images/vegetable_garden.jpg" alt = "Vegetable garden.">
					<p>The thrid project we run throughout the year is around the restoration of forest around Onslow and the creation of vegetable gardens within Onslow's grounds. We currently have two main forest restoration areas - one up around Waipahihi Stream, the other up on Table Mountain. The aim of forest restoration is to make our school rich in native biodiversity. We have build garden beds and grow great food in our Community Garden on Table Mountain and in our enclosed Education Garden.<br><br>This project also relies on volunteers from the student body (and families). We have a gardening team in charge of planting, tending, weeding, and harvesting our vegetable gardens. This team is also in charge of composting at the school. We also have a forest restoration team in charge of planting, tending, and weeding native plants in our forest restoration areas. Both groups have co-leaders who work with teachers to plan and run gardening and restoration events such as working bees during which volunteers plant trees.<br><br>Picture: a half weeded vege garden (will be weeded soon!).</p>

				<h4>Vegetarian and Vegan Food Fair</h4>
				<p>Our fourth on-going project is run anually early in term 2, held in the hall. This event is held to give students at Onslow the opportunity to try some awesome vegetarian and vegan food and just generally have a great time! It also acts as a fundraiser for Enviro Group projects, including some further afield. Student volunteers under the guidance of co-leaders help to advertise the event, make great food, set up the hall, lay tables, serve food, provide cool music, collect money, and tidy up afterwards. This event has proven a huge success for the three years we have run it so far.</p>

			<h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>
			<article>
				<p>COVID-19 has made any planning here very difficult for a number of reasons, not least of which are the uncertainty that projects/events we schedule will go ahead and the fact that we haven't held many club meetings this year. At the moment, we are tentatively planning a working bee for those who are interested on November 20<sup>th</sup>. Be sure to check closer to the time.</p>
